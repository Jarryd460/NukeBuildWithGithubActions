# Nuke.Build and Github Actions

### Description

* Nuke.Build is a build tool that enables the build of .Net applications. Because it's just a console application that lives within the repository, it comes with intellisense and version control.
* Github Actions is a workflow executor. Workflows are triggered by events which execute workflows which are made up of actions.
